# Context

I'm just getting started with React/React Native. 
It's a pretty cool framework indeed. 
After reading React's documentation, I made this app to practice the concepts I learned - especially, how to manage state with hooks. 

# Setup and run

Clone the app, install the dependencies and run the start script. Of course, you're going to need Git and Node.js installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ajsaraujo/react-native-product-search.git
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

# Screenshot

Isn't it cute? ðŸ¥°

![A screenshot of the app. It has a header saying "My stock", followed by a list of product categories, each containing some products with names, prices and a "out of stock" indicator, when needed. At the bottom, there's an input field to search products by name and a switch to only show products that are in stock](screenshot.png)
